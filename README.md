Use the music organizer right after downloading an album / music release archive
file to put all of its contents into your music folder in your file directory
and into iTunes. Working on getting it into WinAmp...

This will only work if you run the script immediately after downloading the zip / rar.

Also this script is written for windows and users should have rarfile, zipfile
 and eyed3 installed.

Users should tailor the filepaths in this script as is appropriate for their
computer. This script does not have one-size-fits-all functionality, unless
the user has the same file structure as the author.
